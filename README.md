# lowMC_algebraicMITM
The algebraic MITM attack on LowMC

Before running the code to verify the attack, please choose command 1 to generate the file uvalue.txt.

Please make sure that this file exists in the same directory when you run command 2/3.

If you first input 1, wait until command-1 is finished before doing other experiments.

See more in main.cpp.

Please use the command "g++ LowMC.cpp LowMC.h main.cpp -O3 -std=c++11" to compile the code and make sure that all the files are in the same directory.
